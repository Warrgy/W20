  * assign2/ - Analysis and Design of brute force and divide and conquer inversion. Also brute force and divide and conquer of the convex hull.
  * assign3/ - Developed brute force and presort anagram solving algorithm. Additionally, made a brute force string matching, Horspool Algorithm, Boyer-Moore Algorithm.
  * assign4/ - Developed two optimal BST, one with dynamic programming, one with the greedy technique

* __CIS2750/__
  * AKA Software Systems Integration and Development
  * The actual course name was not used since it is quite lengthy. (As you may have noticed)
  * SVGApp/ - Actual GUI (Combination of the back end (in assign/) and the front end (JavaScript))
  * Starter/ - Some starter code given to us
  * assign0/ - Very small assignment to get familar shared libraries
  * assign/ - Back end code for SVG editor (A1 & A2)
    * -src/SVGParser.c contains my 2000+ lines of code for parsing the .svg file, and as well as alot of other functionality.

* __Operating Systems/__
  * Coursework done for my Operating Systems Class, (As you may have thought)
  * assign2/  - Made a CPU scheduling algorithm (Shortest Remaining time first)
    * -Simulation created
  * assign3/ - Made a simulation for memory management and translating virtual addresses to physical
   
* __Statistics/__
  * Assignments me and a group member created.
