0.0026 means that we can be reasonably confident
that the true population mean lies within 0.0026 of the reported mean.
0.0026 is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution. Since
on a normal distribution roughly 68.3% of measurements lie within one
standard deviation of the mean and 0.0026 is the standard deviation of
the sampling distribution, we can be be 68.3% confident that the true
mean 2D:4D ratios of people with congenital adrenal hyperplasia is
within 0.0026 of the reported mean.
