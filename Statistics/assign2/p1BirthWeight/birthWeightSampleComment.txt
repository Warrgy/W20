The author of this study collected pre-existing data from organizatoins
that have Elephants under their care. The author does not say what the
sampling method was of each of these institutions. But he does state
that they're "accredited by the relevant national or international
associations of zoos and aquariums". Given that they're accredited I'm
going to assume that they made a good faith effort not to introduce
bias to their sampling method (I'm guessing they just weighed every
Elephant born under their care). Given that assumption, I think 
unlikely that our sample is significantly biased.
