 HOW TO RUN:

 1. type: make
 2. type: ./assign2 [algorithm]
    algorithm values:
    1.1 <- brute force number of inversion
    1.2 <- divide and conquer number of inversions
    2.1 <- brute force algorithm to solve the convex-hull problem
    2.2 <- recursive divide-and-conquer algorithm to solve the convex-hull problem.
    (ex. "./assign2 1.1" will run the brute force inversion count.)
3. Observe



Program works if there are not 30k points. data_2.txt was altered for this to work. Therefore the expected result for points may be different.
